</div>



	<div class="work_para_text">
Crosschecks is designed to prevent the theft of vehicles from housing societies in New Delhi. These societies are particularly vulnerable during night. The App is designed for Guards, Car Owners and Police Officials. The Guards use the app to ensure that the vehicles leaving and arriving at the society are of valid owners. They generate an OTP for that particular car and then match that with the OTP received by the driver. If the OTP is not matched, the Guard contacts the vehicle owner and verifies the identity of the driver. In case of a failure, the Guard can inform the nearest Police Station for a vehicle theft.

	<div class="work_para_text">
The Guard App is geared towards the confirming the owner of the vehicle by generating the OTP and matching it with the OTP received by the vehicle owner. In case that fails, the guard calls one of the owners of the vehicles through the app.

	<div class="work_para_text">
The Police officials use the app to get a dynamic list of all the vehicles reported stolen in their designated zone. With a list of details about the vehicles stolen, the officials can perform a check on any suspicious vehicle they find, much like guards. They also generate an OTP and confirm it with the driver of the vehicle. If the OTP is not matched, the police official establish contact with the designated police station. The list is dynamic and updates with each theft reported. Color is a key component for the officials to track and identify a vehicle in the real world. The color code for a vehicle on the app is matched with the exact color of a particular model. Using typographical heirarchy, the vehicle name is made easy to scan.

	<div class="work_para_text">
The vehicle owner is requested to upload their vehicle details on the app and keep them updated. The owner also uploads the details of the his/her family on the app. Every member of a family is assumed as an owner of all the vehicles of the family. When an OTP is generated by a guard or a police official, the same OTP is sent to the owners of the vehicle.

</div>



	<div class="work_para_text">
The most critical component of the Guard and the Police App was the Confirm-Reject widget. This widget indicates the most crucial action of confirming or rejecting the owner of the vehicles by the guards and police officials. We used traditional colors for indicating a confirm and reject action. The colors differ in saturation as well as brightness enabling people with color blindness to easily differentiate between them. The text label alongside it ensures that people with disabilities understand the action associated with the buttons.

While designing the icon for alert action, we decided to use the a tilted alert icon alongside the default call icon on android to ensure that the overall message is still neutral. This ensures that the icon does not have a negative outlook either.

<div class="works_title_line"></div>
</div>



	<div class="work_para_text">
As most of the vehicle thefts take place during the night, and therefore the workload for the security guards increases significantly during the night it was natural to have a night theme for the app. This was especially important for the app meant for the guards as most of the workers are old aged and have lower vision than most of the people.
