My Role and Brief

	<div class="work_para_text">
I was involved in the design overhaul for the Goqii Coach App while working freelance with TouchPoints Inc. I worked alongside backend engineers, frontend developers and research team and took care of the UX and the visual design of the coach app. The GOQII Coach App is an application to help Coaches train, track and communicate with players effectively. It also helps coaches stay on track for their monthly challenges.

Theme

	<div class="work_para_text">
The Goqii theme is smart, fun and interactive. Goqii started off with a balanced color scheme with toned down hues. As they started to expand, they felt the need to reflect the fun and interactivity of the Goqii Band. We opted for a little more vibrant and bold secondary colors while keeping the primary color consistent for the Coach App, so that the users still recognize the Goqii brand.

	<div class="work_para_text">
We decided to use Gotham as the typeface for the Goqii theme as its thin strokes and proportional characters help create a theme of intelligence. Gotham also contains a number of weights for different text hierarchies.

The illustration on the home screen is a fun and inviting. The home screen provides the coach a quick review of the activity and the progress made by the players assigned to him/her. The Coach can quickly change or assign a goal to any player with the add goal button. The fun colors in the illustration and the welcome message set in a large type size give an inviting feeling to the home screen.

Prototyping

	<div class="work_para_text">
Because the majority of the visual styling decisions were already in place from the design system, I turned my attention to the interaction design — which involved prototyping… from scrolling interactions and shadows, to focus states and animation.These prototypes were also used in extensive user testing, which were performed every 2 weeks to ensure we didn’t get too lost in exploration or polish — and were remaining true to our hypothesis and design principles.The below example, showing how a board can be filtered by assignee, is a good demonstration of how visual decisions needed to be made in code rather than from static design files.
